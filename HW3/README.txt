In order to run this program please perform the following:

- Open up the terminal or command prompt to the ML_Assignment_Two directory
- Type in: python logistic_regression.py


Output:
All lines involved in the plotting process have been commented out so that this code can easily
be run on the engr server. These lines have been left in the script just in case you wanted 
to see the code used to produce the plots we have in the report.


NOTE: The program does not take in any input as arguments. It does however need to read in the
usps-4-9-train.csv and usps-4-9-test.csv files, as they contain the housing market data.

Assignment_Two_Final.html is a file of the Jupyter notebook at we used for inital development.
